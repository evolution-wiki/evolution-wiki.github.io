Welcome to the evolution.wiki!

This is the place for everyone interested in evolution to share insights, ideas, research, models, simulations and experiments. Evolutionary forces are at work in dozens if not hundreds of fields including but not limited to, biology, ecology, economics, business, computer science, cellular automata, market analysis, mathematics, behavior and on and on. This is the place to explore and share this complex and fascinating world.

This is not the place to air views that evolution in any particular area of study is not real. Reality is not at issue. The study of self selecting, self modifying, self correcting, and self sustaining ecosystems of autonomous parts and/or processes is.

Equally this is not the place for trolling, stalking, hacking, spyware or malware. Although clearly evolution can play a roll in those activities, this is not the place for engaging in them. It is however, the place to discuss them from the standpoint of evolutionary change and development.


Possible structure:

Sandbox for simulations/ models/ games with comment/discussion threads

Theoretical exploration area with debate/discussion threads


Each of the above can be indexed by the authorâ€™s key words with regard to Area, Field and Aspect 

1. Area (ideas, insights, research, models, simulations and experiments)

2. Field (biology, computer science, etc.): the number and specificity of which are subject to change. 

3. Specific Aspect (utility, process, outcome, initial condition, etc.) the author wishes to explore.
